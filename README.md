<h1>Aurivo Automatic Notification Service</h1>

The purpose of this service is to send SMS notifications and group emails to specific alert groups.

<h3>SMTP Client</h3>
The simple smtp client was used to send the mail messages and to send a report once the service has been stopped to inform me how many messages were sent and to who.
<h3>Database</h3>
If you are finding it hard to understand the code its probably because you dont have a database to go with this code. The reason I havent included the databse is for security reasons. If you would like to know how I created the database please get in touch on my website, or leave a comment here on the Hub.
